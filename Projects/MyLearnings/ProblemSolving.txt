When problem solving a new algorithm solution:

1. Understand the problem.  Read multiple times
2. Manually solve problem using test data
3. pseudo-code problem into a solution
4. Code to solve
5. Optimize.  Look for corner cases
6. test test test


When problem is a bug/production issue/etc:

1. Understand the problem.  what lead to problem.  narrow down. 
2. Examine evidence, hopefully there's a good exception message.
 a. logs
  i.	iis
  ii.	sql logging 
  ii.	files
  iii.  windows events
 b. source code.  based on excpetion message.
 c. replicate on localhost and debug into
